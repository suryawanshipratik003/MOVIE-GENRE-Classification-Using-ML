# MOVIE GENRE Classification Using ML
 MOVIE GENRE Classification Using ML
# **Methodology**:
1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3. Data Visualization
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Selection
6. Model Training and Evaluation


#**1. Data Collection**
For the purpose of designing a Movie Genre classifier, we collected the dataset from Kaggle. The dataset consists of movie-related information sourced from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). IMDb is a widely recognized online database that provides comprehensive details about movies, TV shows, cast and crew, ratings, reviews, and more.

The dataset contains a diverse range of textual information, including plot summaries and other relevant details about various movies. This textual data will serve as the basis for training our machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie.

#**2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
We will clean and preprocess the data 
- Removing duplicates
- Removing Nan rows and column
- Preprocessing the Data

#**3. Data Visualization**
Will try to analyse the data using Histogram and Bar Chart.
And will show word cloud for each genre.

#4.** Feature Engineering**
  In this step we will remove unnecessary column which are not necessary for our model

#5.** Model Selection & Training**
In this section we will try to apply CountVectorizer and TF-IDF technique and try to predict accuracy on model.
